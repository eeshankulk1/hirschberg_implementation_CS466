# hirschberg_implementation_CS466_Eeshan Kulkarni
Implementation of the hirschberg algorithm as well as several others for benchmarking purposes. Includes scripts for each algorithm, its corresponding tests, and a jupyter notebook for comparing the 3.

Algorithm scripts can be ran individually to perform a sequence alignment using the respective approach. The testing scripts can be ran to test each algorithm on a variety of alignment cases. 

Testing scripts might be modified due to adjusting of functions.

Documenting/commenting of code assisted by generative AI (ChatGPT). Test cases generated with the help of generative AI.

Function to generate all possible alignments in brute force algorithm, as well as function to print alignments pulled from: https://johnlekberg.com/blog/2020-10-25-seq-align.html
